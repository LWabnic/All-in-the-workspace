/*Exercise:

        - The two subclasses should have their own custom constructors to set any relevant values.
        - The two subclasses should also override a method from the Person class and implement it differently.
        - All three classes should override the toString() method in order to print some useful information about the class.
        - The Subclass toString() methods should include the same information as Person, but with their own unqiue info on top.
        - Use encapsulation - private class variables with getters & setters.
        - Use a separate runner class with a main method.*/
